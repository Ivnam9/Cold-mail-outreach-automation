# Pipeline methodology

This is a longer write-up of how each stage works and why, for anyone adapting this to
their own outreach campaign.

## 1. Scrape

The goal is a real, current research description per person — not their job title, and
not a category label someone else assigned them. Titles like "Professor of Computer
Science" say nothing about whether someone works on vision, security, or theory; two
people with the identical title can have zero research overlap.

In practice, most university sites fall into one of three buckets (see
`src/scrape/scraping_patterns.py` for the matching code):

- **WordPress-backed sites** often expose a REST API (`/wp-json/wp/v2/<type>?slug=...`)
  that returns a person's full bio as clean-ish HTML, much faster than fetching and
  parsing rendered pages one at a time.
- **Sites with embedded JSON-LD** (`<script type="application/ld+json">`) frequently put
  a person's bio right in the page source, keyed by an `"identifier"` field with their
  name, immediately followed by a `"description"` field with their bio. Watch out: the
  same page often *also* has an unrelated, generic page-level meta description earlier
  in the HTML using a bare `"description":"..."` key with no identifier nearby — anchor
  your regex to the identifier so you don't grab the wrong one.
- **Static server-rendered directory listings** sometimes put a short research-area tag
  inline for every person on one page, with no separate profile page needed at all. This
  is thinner data (a tag, not a paragraph) but can cover an entire department in a single
  fetch, versus 100+ individual requests to a per-person page — several of which, in
  practice, turn out to be a client-side SPA a plain HTTP fetch can't see into at all.

A recurring quality issue on the static-directory pattern: some professors' entries have
their research-area field overwritten by their honorific title ("President's Chair
Professor and Dean") instead of an actual description — usually the more senior/famous
faculty, ironically. If you see this on a handful of entries, look those specific people
up individually rather than leaving "Dean" as their stated research area.

**Never fabricate or pattern-guess an email.** Only set it when actually found published
on an official page. A blank field is honest; a guessed `firstname.lastname@domain.edu`
produces bounces and reads as careless if it lands on a monitored catch-all inbox.

**Every record also needs the recipient's university/location and IANA timezone**
(`"university"` and `"timezone"`, e.g. `"America/New_York"`) — this is what lets the sender
enforce the Tue/Thu 7:30-9:30 AM window in *their* local time rather than the sender's. Since
a scraper targets one site at a time, every person it returns shares the same institution and
(almost always) the same timezone, so pass both in as fixed arguments to the scraper function
instead of trying to detect them per-person. Look up the correct zone for the institution's
actual city rather than guessing, and never default to IST or any other zone — an invalid or
missing timezone is rejected loudly downstream (`src/schedule/scheduling.py`) rather than
silently mis-scheduling that person's email.

## 2. Classify

`src/classify/domain_classifier.py` scores a bio's lowercase text against each domain's
keyword list and picks the highest-scoring bucket. It's crude on purpose — a full ML
classifier is overkill for a few hundred people you're going to review by eye anyway —
but crude scoring has a real failure mode worth knowing: **keywords that are substrings
of each other double-count a single mention.** `"medical"` is a substring of
`"biomedical"`, so a bio that says "biomedical" once scores 2 for a domain that lists
both, potentially outweighing a genuine match elsewhere. Keep each domain's keyword list
to genuinely distinct terms, or account for the overlap deliberately.

Buckets with no real project overlap for your background should be marked `weak_fit:
true` in config — they get an honest, openly generic email ("interested in your group's
work on X") rather than a forced, over-specific pitch stitched from a thin match.

**Sanity-check the classifier against real content, not titles**, once you have a batch
of real scraped data. In production use of this pattern, roughly a quarter of people at
one target institution turned out to be misclassified when checked against their actual
bio instead of trusted from their department label — including, in one case, two of the
most prominent researchers at the institution, who would otherwise have received the
generic weak-fit email instead of a properly personalized one.

## 3. Generate

`src/generate/email_generator.py` builds each email from `config.yaml`: an opening line
naming 1-2 of the recipient's *actual* topics (not their whole research portfolio — that
reads as "I copy-pasted your bio"), a background paragraph assembled from your flagship
project blurbs (ordered by relevance to their bucket) plus one domain-specific secondary
blurb, and a fixed closing.

Topic-phrase extraction (`extract_topic` in the classifier module) tries a handful of
common self-description patterns first ("research interests include X, Y and Z") and
falls back to a generic domain-name phrase if nothing matches cleanly — deliberately,
since a bad regex match stitched into a sentence produces something worse than an honest
generic line. Expect roughly 15-25% of real bios to need a hand-written topic override
even with a decent pattern list; that's normal, not a sign something's broken.

**The single most bug-prone part of this pipeline is text normalization** — anything that
trims, re-cases, or reformats scraped text. Two real corruption bugs hit in production
use, neither of which threw an exception:

- A naive approach to stripping a word's punctuation for casing purposes
  (`re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "", word)`) strips *internal* hyphens too, not just
  leading/trailing punctuation — `"Cross-language"` silently became `"crosslanguage"`.
  A more broken version of the same idea, which tried to reassemble the original
  punctuation around a stripped "core", instead duplicated fragments of text:
  `"Tan Lip-Bu"` became `"Lip-Bulipbu"`.
- A word-by-word punctuation strip deleted commas that were acting as separators
  between list items, turning `"computational intelligence, multi-agent systems"` into
  a run-on `"computational intelligence multi-agent systems"` with no punctuation
  between the two ideas at all.

The fix in both cases was the same: don't rebuild strings from stripped fragments.
Transform only the alphabetic runs in place (`re.sub(r"[A-Za-z]+", repl, text)`) and
leave every other character exactly where it was. If you modify this logic, run it
against real scraped text afterward and read a sample of the output by eye — these bugs
are invisible to `python script.py` running cleanly; they only show up when you actually
read what got generated.

## 4. Export

One Excel sheet per domain bucket, largest first, for human review. Nothing here should
be surprising — it's a straightforward `openpyxl` workbook builder
(`src/export/build_workbook.py`).

## 5. Send

**Every row only sends inside its own Tue/Thu 7:30-9:30 AM window, in the recipient's own
local timezone** (`src/schedule/scheduling.py`, gated in `src/send/send_batch.py` via
`build_queue`/`is_due_now` and mirrored in the notebook). This is checked fresh on every run
against the real current time — never a precomputed date, and never the sender's own
timezone or a hard-coded "IST" assumption. `zoneinfo` (the stdlib IANA tz database) handles
DST transitions correctly, so the same recipient-local wall-clock time maps to a different
UTC instant in summer vs. winter automatically.

Because eligibility is just "is it due right now?", there's no long-running scheduler process
to keep alive between sends — that's what makes this compatible with Windows Task Scheduler
(or `cron`) instead of a Python process that has to stay up for days. Point Task Scheduler at
`send_batch.py` on a recurring trigger (every 15-30 minutes is plenty); each run queues
whatever rows are due *right now*, sends them, and exits. A row that isn't due yet is skipped
(not logged — it was never attempted) and picked up automatically on a later run once its
window opens, so future Tuesdays and Thursdays keep getting served with no manual
re-scheduling. A row with a missing or invalid `timezone` is skipped with a clear reason
rather than ever being sent blind.

Two sender implementations, same underlying logic:

- `src/send/mailer_notebook.ipynb` — interactive, for supervised runs where you want to
  watch each send happen (dry run first, review the output, then send).
- `src/send/send_batch.py` — a standalone script with no notebook/kernel dependency, for
  scheduled/unattended runs (cron, Windows Task Scheduler).

Both read every credential from environment variables (`.env` — see `.env.example`),
never hardcoded. Both track sent addresses in a per-batch log CSV so re-running a batch
never double-sends. Both cap the send rate (60s between sends by default) — a burst of
sends in a few minutes on a shared institutional relay is what gets accounts
rate-limited or suspended, and the account behind that relay is often also your primary
login.

**A note on IMAP "Sent" copies:** SMTP only relays a message — it doesn't store a copy
anywhere on your end. If you want proof in your own Sent folder, the mailer can `APPEND`
a copy via IMAP after each send. Some institutional networks restrict IMAP access to
on-campus/VPN connections even when SMTP sending works fine from anywhere; if IMAP login
fails, sending itself still works, you just won't get the automatic Sent-folder mirror.

**Always send one test email to yourself first**, with the real credentials and the
real resume attachment, before touching a real batch. Confirm it arrived, the resume
opened correctly, and both the plain-text and HTML rendering look right.
